Personal profile site for Zach Saffrin - [http://zachsaffrin.com](http://zachsaffrin.com)

This portfolio is a Gatsby site, composed with React and GraphQL, styled with styled-components, using webfonts from Google Fonts and FontAwesome.

This repo is a clean start at version 7.0.0 when I refactored to a Gatsby site. For previous version history, please refer to the [zs-homepage](https://github.com/zsaffrin/zs-homepage) repo.
